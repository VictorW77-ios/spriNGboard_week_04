The assignment syntax with parentheses read out the error: conversion from 'int' to non-scalar type 'std::vector<int>'. Off the top of my head, I think it's because the compiler wants the vector's elements assigned with curly braces in order to accept any data type in the vector. After doing some research, I learned about direct initialization and copy initialization. Though I may be wrong, in the case of constructor-like syntax, the elements are initialized directly with no conversion. It seems that the compiler interprets v = (10,5) as a copy initialization and is looking for a way to convert the integers to the non-scalar vector.
